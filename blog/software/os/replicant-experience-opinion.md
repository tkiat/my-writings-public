# Replicant: My Experience and My Take on It

Replicant is a FOSS mobile operating system endorsed by FSF. I overviewed once in another post before so I am not going to repeat it here.

## My Experience

### Mobiles (Samsung Note 2 N7100)

My experience in Note 2 is top-notch (fast and responsive) but only the back camera works. When I switch to the front camera, it, including the subsequent camera sessions, will output an error. The workaround is to remove the camera app cache.

- Click the Apps icon.
- Drag the Camera icon to the top of the screen to 'App Info'
- Click the 'Clear data' button.

### Tablet (Samsung Tab 2 P3100 and P5100)

Unlike Note 2, Tab 2 is barely usable, i.e. very slow. The horizontal rendering for tab 2 is a bit problematic with a slight tearing diagonally. Many browsers don't work, what works for me are a default browser and DuckDuckGo. If you can't watch a video, stream it to VLC instead. VLC didn't work well for me either. The video resolution supported in these old devices is low (720p is probably the upper limit). I use Tab 2 only for reading.

## My Opinions on Replicant

It is always good to offer a way to have a FOSS operating system but it doesn't seem to be the long-term solution. Android itself is open-source but unfortunately, almost every hardware manufacturer produces non-free firmware that prevents Replicant from being viable in modern hardware. Relying on Android means the operating system itself is left to the mercy of Google.

The better way is producing the hardware that is Linux or other FOSS operating system friendly. I have seen some initiative from Purism and Pine64. Librem5 and PinePhone are compatible with Linux with some firmware blob still needed to perform some tasks. It is at least very promising as they are open platform for any compatible OS to run on. Not being dependent on Google apps and services enables them to gravitate more to open-source software and perform lifetime updates.
