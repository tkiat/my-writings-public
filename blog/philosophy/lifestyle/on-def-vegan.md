# On the Proper Definition of Veganism

## Something Doesn't Make Sense from the Ethical Perspective

[The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganismhttps://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) defines veganism as

> Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.

In shorter terms, vegan does **two actions**.

- exclude all forms of animal exploitation as much as possible
- promote animal-free alternatives

I find the first action sensible but not the second one. Let's say a wild pig fell off the cliff to death because it was very windy. A person found that pig and shared the meat with his neighbors, saying he just saw it fall off the cliff. How does it apply to the definitions above? The meat is an animal product yet it fits the first action as there is no animal exploitation from humans here. According to the second action, that person shouldn't distribute his meat.

This doesn't make sense from the ethical perspective as a dead animal is, just like plants, not anymore a sentient being, and eating it, in this case, doesn't promote the meat industry. Eating the meat, while not unethical, is even more ethical than wasting it away because that is a more efficient use of resources.

Another example here is that it is not unethical to use abandoned animal parts. I also cannot find how wearing a second-hand leather suit while keeping it secretly with you without advertising can be unethical.

## A Proper Definition Should Have a Clear Link to Its Basis
Many vegans just follow rules and abstain from using animal products no matter what and this is an excellent practice. But, I fail to find the supported basis here of why we should do that. The elimination of animal exploitation is certainly not a basis for not eating meat as seen in the earlier wild pig example.

## My Definition of Veganism
We all know that vegans are concerned about animal welfare. But, what is the basis that supports animal welfare? Is it a good home, good food, no human intervention, or organic? The most fundamental prerequisite for vegan I can think of is "no animal exploitation". It is therefore reasonable to use this most fundamental value as the initial definition.

> **Veganism is a way of living without animal exploitation.**

I am going through the statements below and then adjust my definition if I find a loophole. Of course, you might not agree with my interpretations of the statements below and that is fine. This means you will have different definition than mine.

### Statement 1
> It is still vegan to eat a dead animal as long as you don't directly exploit it or support, in any way, someone who exploited that animal.

This statement sounds logical as there is no reason at all not to eat a dead wild animal. This doesn't apply, of course, to a farm animal where money given to the supplier will result in further exploitation. This statement conforms to my definition so there is no need to change it.

### Statement 2
> It is still vegan to eat plants with a pesticide used in the process.

This statement is valid in most cases. Typically, a person doesn't grow his food and relies on a food supplier. There is no way he can know what happened in the process. Even if he does, sometimes he needs to eat it if there are no other convenient choices.

But, this doesn't conform to my definition of veganism. I should change it to

> **Veganism is a way of living excluding as much as possible animal exploitation.**

### Statement 3
> It is still vegan to kill and eat a pig on the islands, given that you will starve to death otherwise.

If we treat humans as animals (I do), then the definition of veganism extends to humans as well and there is no clear winner here. If I were in that situation, I would have prioritized myself because the fundamental selfishness resonates with me: any being wants to survive. The "as much as possible" in my definition is still pretty vague here, I now have to adjust it a bit.

> **Veganism is a way to keep living excluding as much as possible animal exploitation.**

I will add more statements later including an oyster related one.

## Final Word

Veganism should not be about following some rules blindly but rather aligns with your values and motivation.
