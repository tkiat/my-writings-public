# On the Proper Definition of a Vegan Diet

This article first expresses my reasonings of why people shouldn't mistake vegan diets for animal-free diets. Finally, I am going to construct how the definition of reasonable vegan diets should look like.

## Something Doesn't Make Sense from the Ethical Perspective

[The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganismhttps://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) defines veganism as

> Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to **exclude**—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of **exploitation** of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, **promotes** the development and use of **animal-free alternatives** for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.
<center>I make some words bold</center>

This definition, in an oversimplified term, suggests vegans should not support animal exploitation but promote animal-free alternatives. The `no-exploitation` part is obvious, and the word `promote` is quite a weak word since it doesn't explicitly state how much should be done. This makes the statement stay logical sound. However, all the vegan resources including [The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/how-go-vegan) equate vegan diets as animal-free diets and I cannot agree with this.

This is because excluding animal exploitation is not the same as not eating meat. Let's say a wild pig fell off the cliff to death because it was very windy. A person found that pig and shared the meat with his neighbors, saying he just saw it fall off the cliff. The meat is an animal product yet there is no animal exploitation from others here. The distribution of the meat shouldn't be considered as promoting animal exploitation as he explicitly says how he got it in the first place.

A dead animal is, just like plants, not anymore a sentient being, and eating it, in this case, doesn't promote the meat industry. Eating the meat, while not unethical, is even more ethical than wasting it away because that is a more efficient use of resources. For this reason, I never understand vegan guides that forbid the use of any animal product. A principle should be driven by wisdom, not by some arbitrary rules.

Another example here is that it is not unethical to use abandoned animal parts. I also cannot find how wearing a second-hand leather suit while keeping it secretly with you without advertising can be unethical.

## A Proper Diet Should Have a Clear Link to Its Basis

Many vegans just follow rules and abstain from using animal products no matter what and this is an excellent practice in terms of ethics. But, I fail to find the supported basis here of why we should do that. The elimination of animal exploitation is certainly not a basis for not eating meat as seen in the earlier wild pig example.

## My Definition of a Vegan Diet

We all know that vegans are concerned about animals. But, what does that even mean? We know that a good home, good food, and safety contribute to animal welfare, but they are the shallow visible results — the outer bark of a tree. The thing that should be included in the definition of a vegan diet should be something most fundamental. The best one I can think of is "no animal exploitation". Therefore, I am going to include this within the initial definition, which is very vague.

> **Vegan Diet is any diet free of animal exploitation.**

I am going through the statements below, then I will adjust my definition if I find a loophole. Of course, you might not agree with my interpretations of the statements below and that is fine. This means you will have a different definition than mine.

### Statement 1
> It is still vegan to eat a dead animal as long as you don't directly exploit it or support, in any way, someone who exploited that animal.

This statement sounds logical as there is no reason at all not to eat a dead wild animal. This doesn't apply, of course, to a farm animal where money given to the supplier will result in further exploitation. This statement conforms to my definition so there is no need to change it.

### Statement 2
> It is still vegan to eat plants with a pesticide used in the process.

Typically, a person doesn't grow his food and relies on a food supplier. There is no way he can know what happened in the process since the label doesn't expose this kind of information. Even if he does, sometimes he needs to eat it if there are no other convenient choices.

But, this doesn't conform to my definition of veganism. I should change it to

> **Vegan Diet is any diet free of — as far as is practicable — animal exploitation.**

### Statement 3
> It is still vegan to kill and eat a pig on the islands, given that you will starve to death otherwise.

If we treat humans as animals (I do), then the definition of veganism extends to humans as well and there is no clear winner here. If I were in that situation, I would have prioritized myself because the fundamental selfishness resonates with me: any being wants to survive. This aligns with the word `practicable` in my current definition so there is nothing to change here.

I will add more statements later including an oyster-related one.

## Final Word

A vegan diet should not be about following some rules blindly but rather aligns with your values and reasons. My (current) vegan diet definition is

> **Vegan Diet is any diet free of — as far as is practicable — animal exploitation.**
