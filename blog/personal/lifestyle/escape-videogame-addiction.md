# How I Escaped Video Game Addiction and My Take on It

I estimate that I have spent at least 5500 hours in my life on video games. It was a fun journey with a splash of addiction. I found that many games are not created equally, some made me more addicted and resentful and a few are excellent that I praised them over and over again. This article explored my experience as a gamer and how I escape the addiction rabbit hole.

## My Top-8 Ranking in Hours (Self-Estimate)

| Title                      | Usually Online? | Hours |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ----- |
| Clash Royale               | Yes             | 2200  |
| dotA 1                     | Yes             | 2000  |
| Hearthstone                | Yes             | 400   |
| Battle Realms              | No              | 400   |
| Gwent                      | Yes             | 150   |
| Red Alert & Yuri's Revenge | No              | 150   |
| Hollow Knight              | No              | 40    |
| Planescape: Torment        | No              | 35    |

The first two longest are both online games. Dota is a PC game with around 30-60 minutes per match. Unlike Dota, Clash Royale is a free-to-play mobile game with only around 5 minutes of match length. An inherent danger of a free-to-play game is that a game maker have an incentive to make games as addictive as possible by exploiting the rewarding-circuit in human brains to keep the game alive. Couple with the fact that online games often have no endings, people can waste hours on them.

I spent significantly less time on offline games. Not only do they usually have endings, but they also don't usually exploit human psychology. Why? They only get a one-time payment and naturally should have more incentive to move their players on to their next game. Among offline games, Battle Realms is an outlier because I got it when I was 13 and basically that was the only choice I had. I did have a lot of fun though.

## The Pointless Accumulation

I was not known as a digital pirate since I was young. I only bought a genuine game in a box and was very proud of my ethics. After the beginning of the steam era, I had never tried to accumulate games until I firstly got a monthly subscription from Humble Bundle. That wore out real quick like after 3 or 4 bundles because I realized that I didn't have time to finish any of them.

What hit me hard was GOG. GOG, like steam, is an online digital game store focused only DRM-free games (except Gwent and some small DRM features in some games). What I thought was that I could buy it once and stored it on my HDD forever. It motivated me to keep buying discounted games. Currently, I got around 200 paid games in the library.

Another addiction is getting freebies from Epic Games store. I only finished Celeste so far (and bought 9.99$ soundtracks from Bandcamp thereafter) and I knew that I would never have time to finish every free game they offered. But it was hard to refuse such very good offers, so I wasted time claiming free games every week.

## How Did I Stop the Addiction? One Word: Open Source

It was an open-source mindset that liberated me from all this stuff. I firmly believe now that everything installed on the client-side must be at least open-source because they should make it clear that they don't violate others' licenses and also no malware exists in their products. In addition, I would rather spend time improving the open-source ecosystem rather than playing video games.

And you know what? Almost every game on the market is not open source. As a result, I abandon my free Epic Games account, Clash Royale ID, and all of my Blizzard games as well. I decided to keep GOG account because it is a very customer-oriented company with excellent ToS (in my opinion) but I deleted all of their games from my HDD. I don't play them anymore.

I still play games though but, this time, only open-source games. Many games are available on a typical Linux package manager like SuperTux, SuperTuxKart, and The Battle for Wesnoth. I can also get more games tagged 'open source' on itch.io. GOG sometimes offers games with open-source and proprietary assets like DOOM. None of these games seems to be psychology manipulative so yay! I escaped the addiction.

## My Take on Video Games

I always like to compare video games with novels. A game like Planscape: Torment has around 800000 words of the script, making it comparable to a long novel. A novel has no technical implementation issues found in video games. However, video games have more elements on top of a novel: sound, movie, and freedom to influence the story. In this point of view, it is unreasonable for a novel junkie to reject all games as pointless.

Not every game is addictive and manipulative. Some games, like Playdead's INSIDE, can be finished in a matter of hours with an excellent story and atmosphere. You don't need to reject all games, just choose them wisely.
