# Why I Use DuckDuckGo as a Default Search Engine

DuckDuckGo is a privacy-oriented search engine that started in 2008 (FYI: Google launched in 1997). Unlike Google whose business is built around surveillance capitalism, DuckDuckGo relies on non-targeted ads that match the search keyword and affiliations. It is therefore a search engine of choice for many privacy advocates.

## Reasons

- **Main reason: !bang**. !Bang is its killer feature. It allows the user to take the search term to other websites. Enter !g obama will transfer the search term 'obama' to Google, while !s will redirect you to Startpage. Plenty of websites are supported such as Youtube, Vimeo, StartPage, Reddit, and many more! Go to this [link](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) to find a list of supported bangs available. This feature makes DuckDuckGo my personal one-stop service.
- **Work on tor browser**. People should have the right to use an anonymous browser and, unlike Google, DuckDuckGo supports it.
- **Better privacy policy**. Since I started using Linux, I have become more and more privacy-aware person. I have a creepy feeling each time when someone keeps watching me all the time, the same goes for a search engine. DuckDuckGo has better privacy policy than many other search engines (search online if you don't believe me).
- **Personalized ads and contents make me more stupid**. They narrow my experience so I will become a less well-rounded person. DuckDuckGo doesn't do this.
- **Google might be able to get me better results but I can simply !s**. Startpage is a privacy-focused search engine that gets search results from Google. It puts some ads on top of each page, making it a little less convenient option than Google. It collects strictly anonymous statistics though (from its privacy policy), but I am fine with it.

## Caveats

It is not open-source. A truly open-source alternative is running your own instance of searx.me. I don't choose this path because it is not very convenient.
