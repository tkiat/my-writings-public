# Miminize My Bill with Two Feature Phones and a Smartphone

```text
Smartphones are widespread today.
So do mobile plans.

Roses are red.
Violets are blue.

I just want to be cheap.
And so do you.

## My Choice (Only 130 THB per Month)

- **Main SIM card.** I am using a cheap prepaid plan with very slow but unlimited internet. I put this number in my resume and expect people to call me using this number. The cost is at least only 10 THB per month.
- **Internet SIM card.** In Thailand, a 1 year prepaid SIM card with at least 60 GB internet/month and the unlimited calling plan is quite popular. I use it for the internet and to make a call. The cost is usually 1400 THB per year or around 120 THB per month.

## My Setup

A yearly mobile plan in Thailand is attractive to me. "Yearly" means I cannot expect to repeat the plan indefinitely so I use it along with my main SIM card. This means I am using two SIM cards.

- **Main SIM card for a feature phone.** While a feature-rich smartphone brings us immense benefits, it can sometimes distract us, and using it during work can make us look less professional. Using the main SIM card in a feature can certainly help me focus and look serious.
- **Internet SIM card for another feature Phone.** As a hotspot, I always plug a cable into this cheap feature phone and use it as a hotspot (around 12$) all day and all night (while with me at home). I don't need to care too much about the lifespan of the phone.
- **No SIM card for a smartphone.** I usually use a smartphone at home for social media apps and entertainment. I can take it out with me when I want to take photos outside or use Google maps or OpenStreetMap. This makes me a more organized person.

This way, I get all benefits from a smartphone while I am not constantly distracted by using it.

## What Models Do I Use?

My feature phones of choice are True Super Hero 4G Entertainment (black) and True Super Hero 4G Entertainment Plus (red). The latter is a newer version but almost identical in functionalities. Owning these is an eye-opening experience for me for many reasons.

- Both cost only 10 dollars each. Each even comes with an adapter, a USB cable, and an earphone! The quality of an earphone is abysmal but hey it works!
- They are very repairable, a 5-year-old can easily remove the battery away and replace it.
- They have back cameras, the plus model has a front camera as well. The quality is horrendous, but it just works. Just don't expect to backup any legal document with it.
- Both are capable of a 4G hotspot. The quality is good enough that I can play mobile games absolutely without lagging (most of the time).
- The SIM card is tied to the True corporation (one of the top 3 largest service providers in Thailand). This limits my freedom quite a bit but the device is very cheap anyway. On the plus side, I am not worried too much about signal issues since it has a good infrastructure.

My smartphone model is HTC One M7.
