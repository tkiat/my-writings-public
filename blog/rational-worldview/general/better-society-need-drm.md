# Not All DRMs are Bad for Users' Freedom. We Need Them for a Better Society.

DRM stands for Digital Rights Management. It is a technology that puts some restrictions on the usage of digital content. A DRMed ebook bought from Amazon prevents a user from reading an ebook without an Amazon client. A DRMed game bought from Ubisoft must be started using its client. These DRM adders intend to prevent illegal distributed copies. By contrast, DRM-free media allow you to put it into any device you like given that it supports the media format.

The distributor/publishers all have the right to add DRM to their products, made with their blood, sweat, and tear! However, not every DRM makes sense. There are websites like [Defective by Design](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/) that seem to oppose all DRMs but I disagree with them a bit since I find some benefits of DRMs to users. This article elaborates that.

## How DRMs Undermine Users' Freedom

The DRMs on single-purchased recordable media such as music, movies, and ebooks are ineffective since they cannot prevent everybody from recording it. Everybody can at least use a camera to record a movie, an image to text to record an ebook, or a song recorder to copy a music track. As a result, it cannot at all prevent piracy while punishing the paying customers e.g. restricting them within an app. A DRM-free product with a unique watermark in it is a much more reasonable choice.

To my knowledge, the only effective DRM is the one that serves critical bits from the server like what online games like Diablo 3 do. This always-on DRM has benefits including anti-cheating but it also makes users dependent on the server. Some users may pay a lot of money for nothing when the company is gone.

## How DRMs Enhance Users' Freedom

The validation of these two axioms is sufficient to state that DRMs can sometimes enhance users' freedom.

### Axiom 1
> DRM is essential for subscription services

This sounds logical because users would download everything they want in the first month and stop thereafter if there is no DRM.

### Axiom 2
> Subscription services can enhance users' freedom.

It might sound counter-intuitive because the subscription is subjected to mass surveillance and dependency on the proprietary platform/product. User has to log in with his/her credentials to watch a Netflix movie and the company can record all user activities. However, this is more of a first-world problem and is not applicable to people from underdeveloped countries. All they want is the ability to access the media.

This can be compared to the most bottom section of Maslow's hierarchy of needs (having food). The subscription-based media is cheaper than the DRM-free counterpart when users consume a lot of data in a month. In this case, it can satisfy low-income users the need. This need is at the bottom of the aforementioned hierarchy but at least it is a midway towards better freedom.

The ideal world has both DRM subscriptions and equivalent DRM-free products. This is simply because having two choices is better than having only one choice, given that users are well aware of all options. Some users prefer paying cheaper at the cost of some freedoms and that is OK. It is all about the availability of good things, not the elimination of bad things.
