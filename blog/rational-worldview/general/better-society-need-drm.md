# Not All DRMs are Bad for Users' Freedom. We Need Them for a Better Society.

DRM stands for Digital Rights Management. It is a technology that puts some restrictions on the usage of digital content. A DRMed book bought from Amazon prevents a user from reading a book without an Amazon's client. A DRMed game bought from Ubisoft must be started using its client. These DRM adders intend to prevent illegal distributed copies. By contrast, DRM-free media allow you to put it into any device you like given that it supports the media format.

The distributor/publishers all have the right to add DRM to their products, made with their blood, sweat, and tear! However, not every DRM makes sense. This article explores the relationship between DRM and users' freedom.

## How DRMs Undermine Users' Freedom

I consider DRM in any single-purchased product to be always bad for users. Let's divide it into two cases.

- **Crackable DRM**. Usually, DRM in this case is found in media such as music, movies, and books. There is no point in implementing DRM in such products because it can always be circumvented by using tools such as a recorder, a camera, or a text processor. As a result, a pirater can enjoy that media without any restrictions, unlike the paying customers. A DRM-free product with a unique watermark in it is a much more reasonable choice.
- **Uncrackable DRM**. For example, many online games. A game serves players some data from its server so unless the game source code is leaked people have to code themselves to emulate the server. Unlike crackable DRMs, I give more respect to these products because it at least fulfills its intention well. It provides many benefits including anti-cheating but that also means all users' hope depends on the existence of the game servers. Everything is gone when the game company is gone.

## How DRMs Enhance Users' Freedom

It might sound counter-intuitive but I do consider DRM in a subscription service, in some cases, can enhance users' freedom. Let me elaborate. First of all, we need two axioms.

- **Axiom #1: Subscription services can lower the barrier to entry as compared to a single-purchased product**. If they cost the same as single-purchased products, everyone would rather buy those instead because of no time limit.
- **Axiom #2: Subscription services need DRMs to survive**. Without DRMs, users would download everything they want in the first month and stop thereafter.

Now let's consider a simple users' freedom ranking in some scenarios.

For any particular product,

- **Level 2**: Users also have access to a DRM-free offering.
- **Level 1**: Users only have access to an offering with DRM.
- **Level 0**: Users have no access at all.

DRMs help users, especially poor ones, transition from level 0 to level 1 here (because of lower barrier to entry as in axiom #1, which needs DRMs as in axiom #2). DRMs alone do help enhance users' freedom, only until level 1.

## A Better Society Needs DRMs

Well, let's modify the previous ranking. For any particular product,

- **Level 2**: Users are aware of and have access to both DRM and DRM-free offerings.
- **Level 1**: Users only have access to a DRM-free offering.
- **Level 1**: Users only have access to an offering with DRM.
- **Level 0**: Users have no access at all.

Does this make sense? The reason why DRM-free products also have the same level as DRM products (level 1) is that the higher price nature of DRM-free products can sometimes prevent some users to access the products at all (i.e. remain at level 0). For an analogy lover, you cannot say that tasty fruit that is placed too high can fulfill our need more than or less than a typical one placed below. This depends on the height of each individual, or in our case here: finance.

Level 2 is strictly better than having only DRM-free products available (level 1) due to more choices and users' awareness of choices. A product with DRM, particularly in a subscription service, can be cheaper than its DRM-free counterpart and that's why someone still chooses it.

This brings us to the question of whether 'more choices' leads to compromised users' freedom. I would say no. Why? A user at level 2 might choose products with DRM and if we focus only on that product, it seems he undermines his freedom. But if we step back and put things into a wider perspective, he had all choices in the first place, it is just that he doesn't exercise his right to choose DRM-free products, and that's OK.
