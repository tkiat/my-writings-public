## Something Doesn't Make Sense from The Ethical Perspective

[The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganismhttps://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism) defines veganism as

> Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.

In shorter terms, vegan does **two actions**.

- exclude all forms of animal exploitation
- promote animal-free alternatives

I find the frst action sensible but not the second one. Let's say a wild pig fell off the cliff to death because it was very windy. A person found that pig and share the meat with his neighbors, saying it is not unethical meat. How does it apply to the definitions above?

The meat is an animal product yet it fits the first action as there is no animal exploitation from humans here. According to the second action, that person shouldn't distribute his meat. This doesn't make sense from the ethical perspective as a dead animal is, just like plants, not anymore a sentient being and eating it in this case doesn't promote the meat industry. Eating the meat, while not unethical, is even more ethical than wasting it away because that is more efficient use of resources.

Another example here is that it is not unethical to use animal parts that may cause harm to them.

## A More Proper Definition Should Stem from Some Basis
Many vegans just follow rules and abstaining from using animal products no matter what and this is an excellent practice. But, I fail to find the supported basis here of why we should do that. The elimination of animal exploitation is certainly not a basis as I proved otherwise earlier in the wild pig example.

## The Definition of Veganism
We all know that vegans concern about the animal welfare. But, what is the basis that supports the animal welfare? Is it a good home, good food, no human intervention, or organic? There are many couterarguments for those but I fail to find one for "no animal exploitation". Therefore, here is my definition.

> Veganism is a way of living of excluding as much as possible animal exploitation.

This is very similar to the beginning part of the definition from the vegan society except that I don't satte clearly how not to exploit the animals. This is sensible as the real logic is not always straightforwards. I can draw many logical statements from my definition of veganism.

> It is still vegan to eat a dead animal as long as you don't directly exploit it or support, in any way, someone who exploited that animal.

This statement is also sensible as it conforms the my definition above. There is no reason at all not to eat a dead wild animal. This doesn't apply, of course, to a farm animal.

> It is still vegan to eat plants with pesticide used in the process.





There are more subtle 

Some people might argue that they don't kill animals themselves, and since they are already dead, it is not unethical to eat them. But that is the big fallacy - they still support the continuation of killing and suffering of animals by giving money to the meat industry.
