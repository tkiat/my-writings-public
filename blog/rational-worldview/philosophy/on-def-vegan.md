# On the True Definition of Veganism

TODO add more

It could go very long, but at least these two definitions conflict:

- Vegan = no meat and byproducts
- Vegan = no exploitation of animals

One counterexample is a pig falling off the cliff to death. It is beyond a person below's ability to prevent the accident, and so eating it afterwards doesn't contribute anything to the suffering of that pig.

Those who are vegans because they care about animals are the second definition of veganism. Here are some of the lists of "eating meat/use animal byproducts and still vegan" that I can come up with.

- Raise the animal without causing any suffering and eat it after it dies.
- Eat wild animals that die naturally/accidentally.
- Wear a second-hand leather suit from a previous non-vegan person and live in the cabin alone without anyone realizing the existence of that leather (i.e. not advertising it).

Some people might argue that they don't kill animals themselves, and since they are already dead, it is not unethical to eat them. But that is the big fallacy - they still support the continuation of killing and suffering of animals by giving money to the meat industry.
