# Why I Use DuckDuckGo as a Default Search Engine

DuckDuckGo is a privacy-oriented search engine that started in 2008 (FYI: Google was launched in 1997). Unlike Google whose business is built around surveillance capitalism, DuckDuckGo relies on non-targeted ads that match the search keyword and affiliations. It is therefore a search engine of choice for many privacy advocates.

## Pros of DuckDuckGo

- **!bang makes DDG a one-stop service**. It allows the user to take the search term to other websites e.g. the search term `!g obama` will transfer the search term 'obama' to Google and `!yt` will redirect you to Youtube. Go to this [link](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) to find a list of supported bangs available.
- **Personalized ads and contents make me more stupid**. They narrow my experience so I will become a less well-rounded person. DuckDuckGo doesn't do this.
- **Google might be able to get me better results but I can simply !s**. Startpage is a privacy-focused search engine that gets search results from Google. It puts some ads on top of each page, making it a little less convenient option than Google. It collects strictly anonymous statistics though (from its privacy policy).

## Caveats

Of course, you still cannot truly know what they do at their server. But, it at least has a much better privacy policy than many other search engines. It is also not open-source. A truly open-source alternative is running your own instance of [searx.me](https://searx.me/). I don't choose this path because it is not very convenient.
