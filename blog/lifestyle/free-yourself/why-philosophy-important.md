# Why is Philosophy Very Important in Life?

A today robot is not a sentient being so they don't have problems doing whatsoever assigned to it. They don't need a philosophy or else you just waste its RAM and storage.

On the other hand, if I order you to become a high school math teacher and keep teaching until you are 60. After that, you will retire and live with your dog until you die. Are you going to be fulfilled if you really do it? The answer might be YES for some but NO for many others.

Why? Humans are complex organisms with different personalities and everyone has different ways to fulfill themselves. Some want fame, some want a relationship, some need a lot of money to buy a sports car, and some need to be experts at their craft. None of these is wrong but if you don't really examine yourself, you can fall into the trap of living someone else's dream.

What does it mean by living someone else's dream? It is simply living your life by chasing something such as money, fame, relationship, or some specific virtues or activities only to realize that it is not important to you when you get quite a bit older. This sounds horrible because at that point you will only feel regret.

But our personalities can change. How can we know what we really want? We change ourselves all the time because we focus on shallow or frivolous stuff, these constantly shift our interests and force us to live aimlessly. Instead, we should examine our core values. After we really discover those, everything we do will often, if not always, align together concerning those values which lead to a fulfilled life.

But how to discover your core values? This is when philosophy comes into play. Philosophy helps us become aware of our true values by using logic instead of emotions or external inspirations. Logics are important because they last a lifetime. This allows us to live a fulfilled life and not regret it when we get much older.

This application of philosophy is by far the most important in my opinion because it forms the basis of what we will do until we die. I wish I can write the exact example but I haven't written one for myself yet. I hope the books I am reading will speed up the process by giving me more insight from smart people.
