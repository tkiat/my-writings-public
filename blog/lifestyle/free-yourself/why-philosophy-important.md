# Why is Philosophy Very Important in Life?

A today robot is not a sentient being so they don't have problems doing whatsoever assigned to it. They don't need a philosophy or else you just waste its RAM and storage.

On the other hand, if I order you to become a high school math teacher until you are 60. After that, you will retire and live with your dog until you die. Are you going to be fulfilled if you really do it? The answer might be YES for a few but NO for many others.

Why? Humans are complex organisms with different personalities and everyone has different ways to fulfill themselves. Some want fame, some want a relationship, some need a lot of money to buy a sports car, and some need to be experts at their craft. None of these is wrong but if you don't really examine yourself, you can fall into the trap of not living your dream.

This means you live your life by chasing anything that is deemed good by society or another person only to realize that it is not actually important to you when you get quite a bit older. This sounds horrible because at that point you will only feel regret. It is therefore the best to "know thyself" and pursue your dream.

But our personalities can change. How can we know our true selves? This is when philosophy comes into play. A person engaged in philosophical thinking examines his fundamental values uninfluenced by emotions. This will eventually make him become aware of his values. He can then use those as starting points and adjust everything he does to become aligned with his values. This results in the harmony and happiness.

On the other hand, a person who doesn't know his true values will chase shallow or frivolous stuff, all of which he might later not want anymore. Things will go up and down frequently for he still doesn't have any ideal or purpose to hold on to.
