# Minimize My Bill With Both Feature Phone and Smartphone

```text
Smartphones are widespread today.
So do mobile plans.

Roses are red.
Violets are blue.

I just want to be cheap.
And so do you.

## I Use Two SIM Cards (Only 130 THB per Month)

- **Main SIM card.** I am using a cheap prepaid plan with very slow but unlimited internet. I put this number in my resume and expect people to call me using this number. The cost is at least only 10 THB per month.
- **Internet SIM card.** In Thailand, a 1 year prepaid SIM card with at least 60 GB internet/month and the unlimited calling plan is quite popular. I use it for the internet and to make a call. The cost is usually 1400 THB per year or around 120 THB per month.

## Some Possible Setups

1. Put both SIM cards in the same smartphone having two SIM card slots. This is the most convenient but I can also imagine that the signals around your phone are strong. It is perhaps better to use hand-free calling.
2. Main SIM card in a feature phone and internet SIM card in a smartphone. A feature phone battery can last very long so using the main SIM card that ensures that anybody can always connect with you.
3. Both SIM cards in a feature phone having two SIM card slots and another smartphone without a SIM card. This is my favorite one because I can keep charging a feature phone and use it as a hotspot providing the internet to my smartphone and laptop. This is good because it is very easy and less costly to replace a feature phone battery anyway so why not use it a lot?

## What Models Do I Use?

My feature phones of choice are True Super Hero 4G Entertainment (black) and True Super Hero 4G Entertainment Plus (red). Owning these is an eye-opening experience for me for many reasons.

- Both cost only 10 dollars each. Each even comes with an adapter, a USB cable, and an earphone! The quality of an earphone is not that bad!
- They are very repairable, a 5-year-old can easily remove the battery away and replace it.
- They have back cameras, the plus model has a front camera as well. The quality is horrendous, but it just works. Just don't expect to backup any legal document with it.
- Both are capable of a 4G hotspot. The quality is good enough that I can play mobile games absolutely without lagging (most of the time).
- The SIM card is tied to the True corporation (one of the top 3 largest service providers in Thailand). On the plus side, I am not worried too much about signal issues since it has a good infrastructure.

My smartphone model is HTC One M7. In fact, any cheap smartphone these days will do as long as you are calm.
