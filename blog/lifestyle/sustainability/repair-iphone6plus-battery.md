# Repair: iPhone 6 Plus Battery Replacement

My cousin wanted me to replace the battery for her 7-year old phone. The official repair was around 1600 THB while it cost only almost 300 THB including shipping if ordered from Shopee so I suggested her the later. The battery itself was from China but it had good ratings so I ordered it. The model got the [repairability score](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_6_Plus) of 7 from iFixit unlike HTC one (score 1) that I repaired before so I thought it would be much easier. Turned out, it was not the case.

I followed this iFixit [guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+6+Plus+Battery+Replacement/29424). The (very cheap) tools came with the phone but I found my little screwdrivers more effective. The suction handle that came with the battery was good though.

## You Don't Need to Remove the Screen. But I needed to.

The guide says so but you don't really need to do that. Unfortunately, the battery glue in a form of 3 stripes was very adhesive and I broke all of the stripes instead of pulling them out successfully. I needed to remove the screen so that I had more space to exert some force. The guide recommended heating the phone so my father (who was with me) got a hairdryer and heated the phone a bit. That really facilitated the battery removal.

## Finish

Got another 200 THB for the tip. iphone6 was still in a good condition after 7 years so give props to Apple!
