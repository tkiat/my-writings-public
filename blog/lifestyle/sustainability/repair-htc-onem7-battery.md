# HTC One M7 Battery Replacement

I bought a flagship smartphone (HTC One M7) in 2013 because I was about to go study in Germany and I wanted to take beautiful photos but I refused to buy a proper camera.

## iFixit Score

iFixit is an excellent website full of guides on how to repair phones and a rating of repairability of each phone. I just realized its existence when my phone battery got swollen in 2020. My smartphone model gets the lowest score of 1 out of 10 from iFixit [Smartphone Repairability Scores](https://www.ifixit.com/smartphone-repairability?sort=score) which means it is hardest to get it repaired.

## Repair Kit

I could go to the shop and let them repair it but that costs more than 800 THB. Instead, I ordered the replacement battery including a simple repair kit online for 314 THB including the shipping cost. Generally, I need to be aware of any unofficial battery but since the review is good I gave it a try.

## Repair

I follow this [guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/HTC+One+Battery+Replacement/30984) on iFixit and after more than 1 hour it is fixed! So many tiny screws.

Moral of the story? Everybody should always take into account the repairability before buying any smartphone.
