# Better Alternatives to Cartridge Razors

Cartridge razors, also known as multi-blade razors, are the most popular of all razors in the market. "popular" does not always guarantee "good", and that unfortunately applies to the current state of a multi-blade razor. I have ditched all of them for a $1 double-edged razor and a $3 shavette, and never looked back ever since. If you are not familiar with a double-edged razor, you should do the research before moving on to the next section.

## Cartridge Razor Offers the Fastest Way to Shave. But,

- **It is usually proprietary.** A cartridge razor is usually not made compatible with many other handles. Double-edged razors, on the other hand, remain consistent in size and form across all vendors. A double-edged razor's user not only has more freedom to choose and change the blade, but he also finds it very easy to give it to others because of full compatibility.
- **The packaging is often unethical.** I have seen many multi-blade makers produce a plastic box containing fewer razors than the available slots. This is clearly done with personal gains, not the environment.
- **Its current design is bad for the environment.** It uses less amount of metal than a double-edged razor blade. However, the blades in the market currently come with non-removable plastic.
- **Some handles are disposable.** Obviously, this really harms the environment.
- **It is very expensive in a long run.** A cheap Gillette multi-blade razor blade costs around 20 THB while a cheap double-edged blade costs 1.2 THB. A double-edged handle can be expensive (> 1000 THB), but I use a 40 THB one exclusively for about a year without any problem until now. Being very cheap, I have to dry it every time to prevent rust.
- **The quality is subpar and inconsistent.** While the first-time experience can be blissful, most multi-blade shavers often shave as many times as possible until the blade is in a terrible state. The worse experience at the end can offset the initial good feeling. A double-edged razor; however, is very cheap that you can replace it often without worry for a truly consistent shave.

## Double-Edged Razor vs Double-Edged Shavette

I consider a double-edged razor to be more efficient in terms of quality per minute. A shavette, on the other hand, is much harder to use initially. I have realized some great advantages after using it exclusively for some months.

- **Joyous and purposeful**. No after-shave feeling is as good as shaving perfectly with no nicks and blood with a shavette. I consider it a real accomplishment, making it a great start to the day! I rarely get a little cut, but when I do I determine to shave better next time. This brings me a sense of purpose.
- **Cool**. No description needed here.
- **More cost-effective (for barbers)**. It's better to dispose of half a blade after one use rather than full.

## Recommended Double-Edged Razor Brands

The skin and beard of each person are different, so do you. It's better to order a mixed set of blades so you can choose the best one for yourself. I am using Dorco ST300 (cheap and work well to me) and Feather (excellent quality and its package can hold like 30+ half-blade razors). I don't open a feather-blade package until the previous package is full of my used razors.

I want to criticize Dorco Prime package for its inability to hold half blades. That's unfortunate because I really like its quality. Gillette Super Thin is great, although I really dislike the shave experience from Gillette Wilkinson (not sharp enough).

## What's about Other Razors?

I haven't tried a real straight razor so far so I cannot write much about it. A feather artist club seems to be proprietary and more wasteful (due to packaging and shipping) than a typical double-edged razor so I am not currently interested in it.
