# On Modern Smartphone Battery Replacement: My Experience With iPhone 6 Plus and HTC One M7

The leaner shape of modern-day smartphones comes at a cost: harder-to-replace batteries. The manufacturers have increasingly made their products harder to repair for whatever reason. Of course, they have the right to produce whatever they want but we should let users repair their products as well since they are the owners. I don't agree with restricting the repair to use only authorized parts because users should have the basic freedom to choose any part for their phones.

Some including the [right-to-repair](https://www.repair.org/) movements discourage these restrictions. One way they can do this is by pushing the laws that forbid such restrictions. Another way is, for us consumers, to research the repairability before buying a product. iFixit is an excellent website full of guides on how to repair phones and [Smartphone Repairability Scores](https://www.ifixit.com/smartphone-repairability?sort=score) of each (popular) phone. I just realized its existence when my HTC battery got swollen in 2020.

## HTC One M7

I bought a flagship smartphone (HTC One M7) in 2013 because I was about to go study in Germany and I wanted to take beautiful photos but I refused to buy a proper camera. My smartphone model gets the lowest score of 1 out of 10 from iFixit which means it is hardest to get it repaired.

### Repair

I could go to the shop and let them repair it but that could cost more than 800 THB. Instead, I ordered the replacement battery including a simple repair kit online for 314 THB including the shipping cost. Generally, I need to be aware of any unofficial battery but since the review is good I gave it a try.

I follow this [guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/HTC+One+Battery+Replacement/30984) on iFixit and after more than 1 hour it is fixed! So many tiny screws. The battery still functions perfectly after 8 months. Thanks! Shopee and the seller.

## iPhone 6 Plus

My cousin wanted me to replace the battery for her 7-year old phone. The official repair was around 1600 THB while it cost only almost 300 THB including shipping if I do it myself so I suggested her the later. The battery itself was from China but it had good ratings so I ordered it. The model got the [repairability score](https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone_6_Plus) of 7 from iFixit unlike HTC one (score 1) that I repaired before so I thought it would be much easier. It turned out that was not the case.

I followed this iFixit [guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+6+Plus+Battery+Replacement/29424). The (very cheap) tools came with the phone but I found my little screwdrivers more effective. The suction handle that came with the battery was good though.

Unfortunately, the battery glue in a form of 3 stripes was very adhesive and I broke all of the stripes instead of pulling them out successfully. I needed to remove the screen so that I had more space to exert some force. The guide recommended heating the phone so my father (who was with me) got a hairdryer and heated the phone a bit. That really facilitated the battery removal.

Finally, I got another 200 THB for the tip. iPhone6 was still in a good condition after 7 years so give props to Apple!
