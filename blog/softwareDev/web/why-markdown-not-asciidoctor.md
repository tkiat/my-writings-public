# Markdown: Why I Prefer it over Asciidoctor for Blog Posts

Many people use Markdown to write documents without making a full-fledged HTML. Being the most popular markup language, Markdown gets supports from everywhere including npm and RubyGems packages, some can watch the change and automatically convert to HTML.

While Markdown is very simple, more complex expressions unsupported by Markdown require the author to write actual HTML tags on his document. This can sometimes make the document full of HTML tags and hard to read. So I tried a more capable markup language, namely Asciidoctor. It can handle more complex documentation than Markdown. It got some supports on GitHub and many more places.

## Why I Prefer Markdown Then?

- General blog posts shouldn't anyway be very complex to engage a reader. Markdown should be very sufficient. Instead of trying a more advanced markup language, one should try to minimize the complexity in the first place.
- Markdown has more widespread support.
