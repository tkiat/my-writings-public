# Coursera Course Review: Cloud Computing Basics

I got this [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing-basics) for free from the offer during the coronavirus outbreak in 2020 so I decided to take a shot. It is a guide to cloud computing with a brief explanation of related technologies. This is a very short course (probably < 3 hours with some preknowledge). The instructor at times reads what is shown on slides and not explains everything that appears on them so I personally don't recommend this course.

## Summary

The instructor introduces cloud computing services, examples, and their business model. A basic idea of cloud computing is that an end-user has no idea about the underlying implementation of the services, everything is a layer of abstraction. It is often scalable and the customer can add or remove resources as needed. Some disadvantages include dependency on the cloud provider, not only for the data but also for the security.

Cloud providers offer a console with a suite of cloud services, which can be categorized into three major types.

- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a very popular service based on a subscription model. Examples: accounting, conferencing, and time tracking tools. More concrete examples include Office 365, Gmail, and Salesforce.
- Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is a popular developer offering. With PaaS, a developer can develop software without the complexity of having to maintain the underlying platform. It delivers firms with "Top of the Line" development frameworks and tools. Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine.
- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) resembles a typical outsourcing model. The firm can outsource the hosting, database, and other specialized techniques to a cloud provider. Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.

Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is similar to PaaS but it is a form of microservices. FaaS offers processing power but it doesn't store data. Customers only pay for the time used in a runtime environment. Examples: AWS Lambda, Google Functions, Azure Functions.

### Deployment Models

- Private, Public, Hybrid, HPC, Big Data Cloud

### Hosting Scenarios

- Bare-metal Computing
- VMs, Docker, and Kubernetes
- On-premises Computing
- Cloud Computing

Lastly, the instructor compares cloud platforms like Azure, AWS, GCP, and IBM Cloud and talks about the future of cloud computing like serverless and IoT.
