# Comparison of Two Coursera Algorithm Specializations

One of the first things I did after coming back to Thailand from a long journey in Germany in Feb 2018 is learning algorithms. I had learned basics during both my bachelor's and master's degrees but as my interest shifted to programming, I wanted to know more. I enrolled in two specializations:

- [Stanford's algorithms specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)
- [UCSD's Data Structure and Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms?). I got hooked after finishing the previous one so I also took this.

I believe I am among a few persons to finish both specializations so I decide to do a prospective learner a favor by writing this post. It took me 1 month for each specialization, and I spent 49 dollars spent for each verified certificate.

## Introduction to Standford's Algorithms Specialization

The specialization focuses deeply on theory. So deep that I sometimes skipped the lecture and just to the assignments! I would recommend this course for an aspiring computer scientist. By the way, I am not impressed with the assignment format. You can just put a correct number to pass the assignment, unlike the UCSD assignments that usually have hidden tests with edge cases.

## Introduction to UCSD's Data Structure and Algorithms Specialization

The specialization offers a lot of coding assignments with a variety of programming languages to choose from. The runtime limit for each submission depends on the programming languages used, with C++ appeared to be less forgiving. So I wrote everything in C++ :) (except one capstone question where I had to use Python instead). This is the hardest MOOC course by far (to me) so I believe newcomers are very likely to take longer than a month. One question in the capstone project took me a day!

Content-wise, the specialization (6 courses) is about basic data structure and algorithms from basic to more advanced. The genome-related courses provide me the insight into how the algorithm can help improve real-life applications. It is hard for me but like every other course in this specialization, there is a healthy amount of hint from the discussion forum. Code copy/paste activity is strongly discouraged of course, but pseudocodes are available. I would recommend this course to anyone.

## My Summary

Standford's course is more theoretical heavy while UCSD's course is more practical (and more workload). Unless you want to become a researcher, do the second one.
